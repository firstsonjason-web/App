# Screen Time Tracking - Native Implementation

## ✅ What Was Changed

### Removed:
- ❌ `useScreenTimeTracking` hook (only tracked in-app usage)
- ❌ App-only screen time tracking via `AppState`

### Kept:
- ✅ `useDailyDeviceUsage` hook (native device-wide tracking)
- ✅ iOS Screen Time API integration (`ScreenTimeUsage.swift`)
- ✅ Android UsageStats API integration

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Real Device Tracking
The app now uses **native platform APIs** to track actual device usage across ALL apps:

#### iOS (ScreenTimeUsage.swift):
- Uses Apple's **FamilyControls** framework
- Monitors **all apps and categories** on the device
- Updates every 5 minutes
- Stores data in App Group shared storage

#### Android:
- Uses **UsageStats** API
- Tracks all app usage on device
- Requires special permission from user

### Data Calculation:

1. **Screen Time**: Total time device was actively in use (all apps)
   - Tracked via: `onSeconds` from native module
   - Displayed as: Hours and minutes

2. **Focus Time** (Off-Screen Time): Time device was NOT in use
   - Calculated as: `daytime - screen time`
   - Formula: `offSeconds = secondsSinceMidnight - onSeconds`
   - Represents time spent doing other activities

3. **Weekly Data**:
   - Stored in AsyncStorage
   - Updated automatically each day
   - Shows 7-day history with bar charts

## 📱 User Flow

### First Time Setup:
1. User opens Progress screen
2. Sees "Enable Device Usage Tracking" button
3. Taps button → System requests permissions
4. **iOS**: Shows Family Controls picker → User selects "All Apps & Categories"
5. **Android**: Opens Usage Access Settings → User enables permission
6. Data starts tracking automatically

### Daily Usage:
1. App monitors device usage in background
2. Updates every 60 seconds
3. Shows real-time screen time and focus time
4. Charts update automatically

## 🔒 Permissions Required

### iOS:
- **FamilyControls** authorization
- **DeviceActivity** monitoring
- User must select what to track (recommend "All Apps & Categories")

### Android:
- **UsageStats** permission
- User must enable in system settings

## 📊 Data Display

### Today's Activity Card:
```
Screen Time: 4h 32m     (actual device usage)
Off-Screen Time: 8h 45m (calculated focus time)
```

### Key Metrics:
```
Avg Daily: 4.2h         (7-day average)
Focus Sessions: 12      (estimated from points)
```

### Weekly Chart:
- Shows 7 days of screen time vs focus time
- Updates automatically as data comes in
- Stored persistently in AsyncStorage

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Accurate**: Tracks real device usage, not just app usage
✅ **Comprehensive**: Monitors ALL apps on device
✅ **Privacy-First**: Data stored locally on device
✅ **Automatic**: No manual input required
✅ **Real-time**: Updates every minute
✅ **Weekly History**: Shows trends over time

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Native Modules:
- **iOS**: `ScreenTimeUsage.swift` (Lines 1-100)
- **Android**: `AndroidUsageStats` (not shown, similar pattern)
- **Bridge**: `useDailyDeviceUsage.ts` hook

### Data Storage:
- **Weekly Data**: AsyncStorage (`weekly_screen_time_data`)
- **Today's Usage**: Native module shared storage
- **Average Calculation**: Real-time from `onSeconds`

### Update Frequency:
- **Native Monitoring**: Every 5 minutes (iOS), continuous (Android)
- **UI Updates**: Every 60 seconds
- **Weekly Data Save**: On each update

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Development Build Required**: 
   - This ONLY works in `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`
   - Does NOT work in Expo Go (native modules unavailable)

2. **Permissions Are Critical**:
   - User MUST grant permissions for tracking to work
   - If denied, tracking won't function

3. **iOS Limitations**:
   - Requires special Apple permissions
   - Main intent is parental controls
   - May require app review approval for App Store

4. **Data Privacy**:
   - All data stays on device
   - No cloud sync (unless you add it)
   - User has full control

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Permission Button:
- Only shows if permissions not yet requested
- Clear call-to-action
- Guides user through setup

### Platform Messages:
- iOS: Explains FamilyControls requirement
- Android: Shows "Enable Usage Access" message
- Web: Shows unavailability message

### Real-time Updates:
- "Refresh" button for manual updates
- Auto-updates every minute
- Visual feedback when data changes

## 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Run on real device**:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   # or
   npx expo run:android
   ```

2. **Grant permissions** when prompted

3. **Use device normally** for a few hours

4. **Check Progress screen** to see real data

5. **Verify calculations**:
   - Screen Time should match device usage
   - Focus Time = Time since midnight - Screen Time
   - Weekly chart should update daily

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Historical data beyond 7 days
- [ ] Export data to CSV
- [ ] Set daily screen time limits
- [ ] Notifications when limits reached
- [ ] Category breakdown (social media, productivity, etc.)
- [ ] Compare with friends (anonymized)
- [ ] Weekly/monthly reports
- [ ] Goal setting for screen time reduction

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "Module not available" message:
- You're running in Expo Go
- Solution: Use `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`

### Screen time shows 0:
- Permissions not granted
- Solution: Tap "Enable Device Usage Tracking" button

### Data not updating:
- Background restrictions may be enabled
- Solution: Check app permissions in Settings

### iOS permission denied:
- User needs to enable in Settings > Screen Time
- May need app reinstall

---

**Summary**: The app now tracks **real device-wide screen time** using native iOS/Android APIs, calculates focus time automatically, and displays everything in beautiful charts with weekly history. No more mock data! 🎉
